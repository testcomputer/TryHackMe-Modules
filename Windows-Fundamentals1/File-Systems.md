The file system used in modern versions of Windows is the New Technology File System or simply NTFS. 

NTFS is known as a journaling file system. In case of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files 
on disk using information stored in a log file. This function is not possible with FAT. (File Allocation Table)
