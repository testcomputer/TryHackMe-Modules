Study Steganography.

Steganography is the practice of concealing information within other information, such as hiding a message within an image,
video, or audio file. The goal of steganography is to hide the existence of the message, as opposed to cryptography, which 
aims to protect the content of the message.

There are many techniques used in steganography, including hiding messages within the least significant bits of image or audio
files, using invisible ink, or embedding messages within seemingly innocuous data such as whitespace or the pixels of an image.

Steganography has been used for centuries, dating back to ancient Greece, where messages were hidden within the wax of wooden
tablets. Today, steganography is used in various fields, such as digital watermarking, copyright protection, and covert communication.

While steganography can be used for legitimate purposes, it can also be used for malicious purposes, such as hiding malware or 
stealing sensitive information. As a result, steganography is an area of interest for cybersecurity researchers and law enforcement agencies.
