## Introduction to TryHackMe & Learning Cybersecurity


[![TryHackMe Website Page][product-screenshot]](https://tryhackme.com)

In today's digital age, cybersecurity has become a critical concern for individuals, organizations, and governments around the world. With the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks, it is essential for everyone to have a basic understanding of cybersecurity and the steps they can take to protect their systems and data.

Here's why:
* TryHackMe provides a hands-on approach to learning cybersecurity, allowing users to develop practical skills and knowledge through interactive challenges and real-world scenarios.
* The gamified approach of TryHackMe makes learning more engaging and enjoyable, providing a clear sense of progression and achievement as users earn points and advance through different levels of challenges.
* By developing practical skills and knowledge in cybersecurity through TryHackMe, users can increase their employability and pursue career opportunities in this rapidly growing field. :smile:

TryHackMe covers a broad range of topics in cybersecurity, including network security, web application security, penetration testing, digital forensics, and more. Users can choose from various learning paths and challenges based on their interests and skill levels.

In addition to its learning paths and challenges, TryHackMe also provides a variety of tools and resources to support users' learning. These include video tutorials, walkthroughs, and a community forum where users can share their knowledge and experiences and ask questions.

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
